Undo last commit:
$ git commit ...              (1)
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1     (2)
$ edit                        (3)
$ git add ....                (4)
$ git commit -c ORIG_HEAD     (5)

1. This is what you want to undo

2. This is most often done when you remembered what you just committed is incomplete, or you misspelled your commit message, or both.
	Leaves working tree as it was before "reset".
3. Make corrections to working tree files.
4. Stage changes for commit.
5. Commit the changes, reusing the old commit message. "reset" copied the old head to .git/ORIG_HEAD; commit with '-c ORIG_HEAD' starts
	with the log message from the old commit and allows you to edit it. If you do not need to edit the message further, you can give -C 
	option instead.
